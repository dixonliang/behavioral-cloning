# Behavioral Cloning Project

This was the fourth project of Udacity's Self Driving Car NanoDegree. The main objective of this project was to create a neural network using Keras to copy a user controlled car through a simulation. The car was able to succesfully navigate through the course autonomously using a model that predicts the steering angle at each part of course.  This respository includes my write up, model code, and output video showing how my code performed.
